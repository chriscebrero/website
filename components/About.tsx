					I am a junior software engineer with a great affinity for problem
					solving. I am highly motivated to learn and take on new challenges. I
					am known by my teams for innovative thinking and as a keen
					investigator of root causes of problems. My background in Mathematics
					as well as Computer Science, helps make programming exceptionally
					rewarding and logical for me. When I'm not building apps and/or working, you can find me playing piano,
					play volleyball, playing Nintendo Switch or tinkering with Logic Pro X
