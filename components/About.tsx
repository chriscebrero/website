						I am a software engineer with a great affinity for problem solving.
						I am highly motivated to learn and take on new challenges. I am
						known by my teams for innovative thinking and as a keen investigator
						of root causes of problems. My background in Mathematics as well as
						Computer Science, helps make programming exceptionally rewarding and
						logical for me. When I'm not building apps and/or working, you can
						find me playing piano, playing volleyball, snowboarding, playing
						Nintendo Switch or tinkering with Logic Pro X
